Hi Everyone!

My name is Marissa Brienza and I am a data scientist, an operations research analyst, and a forever student of the mathematics and statistics field. I work at Booz Allen Hamilton where I use my 3+ years of experience in analysis and visualization strategies to extract knowledge from data to serve a variety of client needs. To me, data science is all about turning data into insightful information that facilitates action. I earned her B.S. in Statistical Science at the University of South Carolina and am finishing up my M.S. in Operations Research at George Mason University. My “free time” consists of good food, good friends, and my adorable pet bunny, Oliver.
